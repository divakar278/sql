# ðŸ§¹ Data Cleaning & ðŸ“Š Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Project using SQL

This repository contains my work on data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA), completed entirely using **SQL**. The project focuses on transforming raw data into a clean, structured format and extracting insights through SQL queries.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

The objective of this project is to:
- Perform **data cleaning** operations using SQL
- Conduct **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** directly within the database
- Summarize and interpret key trends, anomalies, and relationships in the data

---

## ðŸ§¾ Dataset

> **Name:** layoff.csv 
> **Description:** [country, location, layoff count, industry, Layoff Percentage, Date, Fund Raised]
> **Final Output Name:** output.csv

## ðŸ§½ Data Cleaning (in SQL)

I performed several data cleaning tasks using SQL, including:

- Identifying and handling **NULL/missing values**
- Removing **duplicate rows**
- Fixing **data type mismatches**
- Standardizing **categorical values**
- Formatting columns (e.g., dates, text case)
- Removing or flagging **outliers** (if applicable)

## ðŸ“Š Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

EDA is a crucial step in understanding the underlying structure and behavior of the dataset before moving on to modeling or visualization. In this project, all exploratory steps were performed using **SQL queries**, allowing insights to be extracted directly from the database without external tools.

The analysis focused on:
- Identifying key metrics such as average values, totals, and frequencies
- Segmenting data by time, category, region, or other dimensions
- Highlighting trends, spikes, and patterns in customer behavior or sales
- Discovering anomalies and unusual data points for further investigation

By leveraging SQL's power to filter, aggregate, and join data efficiently, I was able to uncover actionable insights that inform decision-making and guide future analysis.


**Example SQL commands used:**
